### Key Points Discussed:

1. **Returns Analysis Issue**
    - Published returns are heavily smoothed
    - Not useful for meaningful economic analysis
    - De-smoothing techniques were ineffective due to near-zero AR(1) coefficient

2. **Recommendations**
    - Use structural models of private equity as starting point
    - Incorporate fund-specific information (Buyout vs VC, vintage year)

3. **Technical Details**
    - Proposed model: $r_{PE}_{t} = 1.15 r_{GCP}_{t} + 0.25 r_{HY}_{t} + \epsilon_{t}$
    - Full analysis available in detailed report

### Next Steps
- Review complete analysis report for implementation details
- Consider alternative modeling approaches based on available data
