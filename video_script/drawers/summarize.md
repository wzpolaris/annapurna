### Key Points:

1.  **Published Returns Not Useful**
    - Published returns are heavily smoothed
    - De-smoothing techniques were ineffective due to near-zero AR(1) coefficient
    - Reported returns <span style="background-color: #a7ffff">do not contain meaningful information for analysis

2.  **Northfield PE Structural Model Applied**
    - Northfield structural models of private equity from asset class perspective used as starting point.
   
    - Private Equity:  

          <span style="color: blue">$r_{PE_t} = \beta_{GSC_t} {\small GlobalSmallCap_t} + \beta_{CE_t}{\small CreditEffect_t} + \beta_{CE_t}{\small Innov_t} + \beta_{NLS_t} {\small CrisisEffect_t} +  \epsilon_{t}$</span>

    - HamiltonLane's fund-specific information (e.g. Fund Buyout % vs VC%, vintage year, economic sector, etc.) <span style="background-color: #a7ffff">superimposed on the structural model</span>


### Recommendations on Next Steps
- Results indicate Fund correlation with equities is ~.60 in normal times. Risk materially higher than broad market, Fund volatility is approximately 28%, compared to 16% for S&P500.
- PE (Buyout) has significant tail risk when there is market stress


### Recommendations on Next Steps
- Contact Hamilton Lane for confirmation/explanation about the reported return series.
- Review full analysis describing application of structural model and overlay; sensitivity test assumptions.
