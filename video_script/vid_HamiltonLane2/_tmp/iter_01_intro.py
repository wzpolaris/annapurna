An issue with reported private equity returns is that they are appraisal-based, not transaction-based, and this results in artificially smooth time series. The smoothing then leads to several well-documented issues:
- Understatment of estimated volatility and true economic risk.
- Lower estimated correlations of PE with public markets.
- Masking of tail and liquidity risks, especially during crises
Technically speaking, smoothing is the result of "serial correlation" in the reported returns. So, a "de-smoothing" analytical adjustment is often applied to get a better estimate the true risk and return characteristics of PE investments.
Often a de-smoothing adjustment is applied on the Fund's reported returns if the time series is to be used in standard performance and risk analyses including scenario testing, optimization, etc.
I will apply the technique to the Hamilton Lane fund's returns.
