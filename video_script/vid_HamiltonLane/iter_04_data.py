I have extracted returns for the Institutional(I) Shares. 

**The performance of Hamilton Lane Private Assets Fund is smoothed and, thus, misleading.**

Since inception (March 2020) the Fund has returned: +15.98% (annualized), compared to +12.89% since inception.

While favorable compared to global equities, the reported monthly series are _extremely smooth_ with low volatility.

I recommend you reviewing this in greater detail as this is likely to be something that needs discussion in your committee meeting.
